Measuring anchoring effect: When a previous stimulus provides a frame of reference.

The data was generated through a little experiment. Four people were asked 24 judgement questions. In each of these questions, participants were first given a random number and a question. Then, They had to answer whether the true answer to the question was higher/lower than the random number. Finally they had to give their 'best guest' for the answer to the question. 

**P.S.:** If you are a student of this course, please try it in another way. This was a group-project in which I was in charge of the data analysis.
